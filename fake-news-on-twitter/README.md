# Misinformation Diffusion on Twitter Network during the 2016 US Election
---
__This is my capstone project for MSc Data Science at the LSE, in collaboration with Qiang Ha 
(another student in the program) and partnership with [Pablo Barbera](http://pablobarbera.com/) 
from the department of Methodology at the LSE.__

This project aims to compare the spread of fake news and true news on both the network level
(graph structures) and the linguistic level (sentiment analysis), and identify characteristics that distinguish fake
news from true news. Using these features, we will use machine learning techniques to identify fake news and
evaluate prediction accuracy of different models.
