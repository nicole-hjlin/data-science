# Image Classification for Poverty Estimation in Rwanda
### Final project for ST449 Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (LT 2019)

In this report “Image classification for poverty estimation,” I studied classification of satellite images with respect to wealth of the corresponding area. This is formulated as a binary classification problem where the goal is to classify a satellite image of an area as either rich or poor. The report is focused on satellite images of Rwanda. The objective is to replicate the results by Xie et al (2016) for a different country.
