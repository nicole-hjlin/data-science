This repo is created with the following objectives:

1. document my learning progress as a data science student at the London School of Economics;
2. share my exploratory data analysis of some publically available datasets;
3. share my applications of modern data acquisition, management, processing, visualizing, and modelling in Python and R;
4. participate in the growing community of data science; and
5. improve my skills and help others learn.

This repo is work in progress and your feedback is highly appreciated. Please contact me at GitHub or by email (nicole.hjlin@gmail.com).
